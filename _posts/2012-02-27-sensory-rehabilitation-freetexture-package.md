The Sensor[y Rehab]ilitation project was recently completed for a competition. We thought it would be beneficial for others to have an assembly of the graphic components we used to create the final image. Although we did not create most of these ourselves, we would like to give away the package for free. Hopefully it will help save you all some time.

<a href="{{ "/downloads/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}sensory_rehabilitation_texture_pack.zip" class="download-btn">Download Package (25mb)</a>

If you like the package, have any comments, want some insight or whatever feel free to contact us or leave a comment below.

Thank you and enjoy!
