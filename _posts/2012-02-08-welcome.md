Welcome to Studio four one four.

We are a group of designers doing what we love. We are passionate, skilled, motivated, and have an ever-expanding urge to create new things.

When one goes to college, it is sometimes to become skilled in what you love so that, one day, you can make a living doing it. The ten of us became friends in college. We went to school to so we can be well-versed in what we love, and be prepared to take on the world.

**This is why Studio four one four exists.**

We pooled our resources, our talent, and our enthusiasm together to provide for ourselves an environment in which we can create, collaborate, and stay sharp. Doing this allows us to work on projects with nothing to lose. We will take on competitions, take a random idea to the next level, and occasionally take an odd job or two from a client.

When the world is ready for us, we are going to be able to say that we never gave up. We took our skills and never stopped pushing them to the next levels. We will have experience, a bigger portfolio, and we will have had fun doing it.
