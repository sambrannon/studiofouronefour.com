This very first 4:14 Sketch is of the Ecotourism Center in France on Arch Daily. Designed by Inca Architectes, the building is “…thought of as a living room in the woods. Its wide and smooth shapes gently wandering along the preserved trees are inspired from the eroded stones seen on the site…” Apparently this is the very first Eco tourism center in this specific region in France. That is cool. It would be even cooler if we knew what that was. Anyway, that’s not quite the point. Enjoy the sketches.
