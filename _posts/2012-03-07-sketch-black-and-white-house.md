A 12000 sqm bungalow set in caldecott drive, singapore designed by [formwerkz architects](http://www.formwerkz.com/). Three volumes of varying sizes are arranged to take full advantage of this triangulated site. Blessed with a relatively untouched forest along the longest length of the site, we ran a 50m long, moat-like infinity pool along its boundary to reflect the foliage. The three volumes and its adjoining courtyards are entirely wrapped in black granite, in stark contrast to a predominately white interiorâ€¦ ([source](http://www.archdaily.com/211912/black-white-house-formwerkz-architects/))
