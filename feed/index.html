			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The modern day loft is the vehicle for living in a manner that is not considered to be a mainstream. The loft usually exists in places that were abandoned, discarded, or thought of as uninhabitable space such as: industrial buildings, the space in between existing buildings or infrastructure, or in this case &#8212; underneath a freeway.</p>
<p>The “Freeway Loft” is an example of a sited and siteless design that can be manufactured all around the world and yet the area that it inhabits is such a niche that there would need to be little to no modification to the overall design whether it was to be constructed in Tokyo, Chicago, or Warsaw.</p>
<p>The FDY-V U3 Duet proSky and FGH-V P2 Gallery Windows by <a title="FAKRO Windows" href="http://www.fakrousa.com/" target="_blank">FAKRO</a> are the perfect complement for this style of living because they are so versatile and can adapt to many locations and orientations.</p>
<p>The fact that the windows can be seen by millions of commuters annually would dramatically increase knowledge of and use of FAKRO’s products worldwide.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Redefining Rustic</p>
<p>The design of today’s typical loft revolves around the concept of creating valuable, quality living spaces within existing urban buildings. This definition of the loft is limiting. The perspective that the loft is a purely urban building typology overlooks a large segment of the population, and furthermore, excludes an important new market.</p>
<p>With vast spaces, a picturesque landscape, and ultimate privacy, the rural countryside offers an appealing setting for a new kind of loft:</p>
<p>A rustic barn – transformed into the enclosure for a dynamic and modern loft space.</p>
<p>This loft is defined by the convergence of old and new. The barn is untouched; honest; historic. It acts as a shell for a modern living space, which pierces through its wooden skin to reveal itself. The modern, glass-clad structure reflects the importance of new ideas; it expresses the 21st century lifestyle that exists within. Striking a balance between old and new – historic and modern – is the foundation of this project. This design is a true expression of this dichotomy in a pastoral setting.</p>
<p>Like its urban counterpart, this rural vision of the loft puts an underutilized building with good bones to use. In doing so, this intervention is fundamentally linked to the Loft typology as we know it. It is also environmentally conscious in the same way. Finding good use for the barn – often a neglected structure in our era – is a rewarding design opportunity and a novel way to achieve the<br />
“new vision of the loft.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Studio four one four has won it&#8217;s first competition!</h2>
<p>Hosted by <a title="Socio Design Foundation" href="http://www.sociodesignfoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Socio Design Foundation</a>, this competition&#8217;s challenge was to distill an idea down to a single vignette. The guidelines? Literally one line; &#8220;Space for the Rehabilitating&#8221;.</p>
<p><span id="more-393"></span></p>
<p>The monthly competition held by the SCF, to &#8220;recognized the spatial impact on the psyche of society,&#8221; is only our second entry into competitions since inception of the group, and has already yielded us a win.</p>
<p>We assembled a team to solve their design problem.  The solution presented was to question the connotations of the word &#8220;Rehabilitation&#8221;, and present in a light that everyone could be part of.  As in our depiction, we took the city and it&#8217;s sensory overloading nature and developed a journey for an individual to take a reprieve, or moment of repose among the chaos.</p>
<p>The figurative tunnel &#8220;journey&#8221; for each person would be to gradually take each stimuli away to make the participant aware of their senses that are being bombarded, and then reintroducing them in a healing way.  Rehabilitating the individual on the personal level.  When fully recharged, they can make the journey back to their daily lives but are aware of themselves and their surroundings; they are rehabilitated.</p>
<p>Team members included: Alex Harm, Joe Buccini, Nick Mather, Ryan Bratz</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have been planning, organizing and collaborating on Studio four one four for about 5 months now. In that time we have learned some things. Perhaps our most important &#8220;learning experience&#8221; happened this last week.</p>
<h3>We learned the hard way what we can and cannot do.</h3>
<p>A few days ago we were contact by the Executive Director of the AIA (Wisconsin) informing us that we were infringing on a few of the core statutes of the state. Specifically <a title="Wisconsin Statute 443.02" href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/document/statutes/443.02" target="_blank">443.02</a>.<span id="more-349"></span></p>
<p>We&#8217;ll give you the express version. We called ourselves architectural designers, which is not allowed. See, we were always taught there is a big difference (legally and morally) between an Architect and an architectural designer. The difference being about 7 years experience, learning a lot of complicated safety regulations, and passing very difficult tests.</p>
<p>Turns out the law doesn&#8217;t really state that difference. If you are a group of individuals, none of which are licensed, and want to start a design group, then the most you can do is that; start a design group.</p>
<h3>You cannot start an <em>architectural</em> design group.</h3>
<p>The reason comes down to the idea that, if you are claiming to offer architectural design services, you convey the message that you offer the same level of safety in your designs that a trained/licensed Architect would offer.</p>
<p>Obviously this is not the case with us. We just want to design, make some awesome renderings, compete in a few competitions, and grow individually so that one day, when the world is ready for us, we can migrate into a real firm more seamlessly.</p>
<h3>Here is what you <em>can</em> do.</h3>
<p>You can call yourself a generic design group/firm/whatever. You can offer residential design services. In fact, you can also offer to design anything under 50,000 sq ft. It&#8217;s limited, but if you have a small budget, work part time, and most importantly don&#8217;t have a licensed person on your staff, then this is probably something you need to think about.</p>
<p>Anyway, we are not going anywhere. We love what we do and no one can tell us not to do it. It&#8217;s all going to come down to how public we can be, and how much we can expect to give back to the community.</p>

&#8220;The metaphor of a tree house was invoked from the onset of design conceptualization to create an environment for learning via a journey of discovery and play. The use of skylights, trellises and colored glass transforms incoming daylight into a myriad of shades and colours, creating an intriguing dappled light quality within the library that simulates light filtered through the foliage of trees.&#8221;<span id="more-313"></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a title="Sensor[y Rehab]ilitation" href="http://studiofouronefour.com/portfolio/sensory-rehabilitation/">Sensor[y Rehab]ilitation project</a> was recently completed for a competition.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In our world, we are continuously influenced by stimuli to all five senses. For our minds to process the massive quantity of information coming from the senses, we subconsciously filter out everything that we deem normal: sights, smells, sounds, textures. This coping mechanism allows us to function in everyday situations, but over time it robs us our ability to truly experience our environment.</p>
<p>Rehabilitation is not a path reserved for the sick; it is a way to return to useful life or good condition through therapy and education.</p>
<p>Sensory rehabilitation involves isolating senses one by one. When a sense is blocked we realize the stimulation that used to be present; we now only recognize the void that is left. Once we have eliminated all the stimuli that were part of our daily lives, we appreciate and recognize them. The reintroduction to stimuli that used to be ignored becomes an experience of transcendence – rejuvenation.</p>

<p>This very first 4:14 Sketch is of the Ecotourism Center in France on Arch Daily. Designed by Inca Architectes, the building is &#8220;&#8230;thought of as a living room in the woods. Its wide and smooth shapes gently wandering along the preserved trees are inspired from the eroded stones seen on the site&#8230;&#8221; Apparently this is the very first Eco tourism center in this specific region in France. That is cool. It would be even cooler if we knew what that was. Anyway, that&#8217;s not quite the point. Enjoy the sketches.<span id="more-248"></span></p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to Studio four one four.</p>
<p>We are a group of designers doing what we love. We are passionate, skilled, motivated, and have an ever-expanding urge to create new things.<span id="more-193"></span></p>
<p>When one goes to college, it is sometimes to become skilled in what you love so that, one day, you can make a living doing it. The ten of us became friends in college. We went to school to so we can be well-versed in what we love, and be prepared to take on the world.</p>
<p><strong>This is why Studio four one four exists.</strong></p>
<p>We pooled our resources, our talent, and our enthusiasm together to provide for ourselves an environment in which we can create, collaborate, and stay sharp. Doing this allows us to work on projects with nothing to lose. We will take on competitions, take a random idea to the next level, and occasionally take an odd job or two from a client.</p>
<p>When the world is ready for us, we are going to be able to say that we never gave up. We took our skills and never stopped pushing them to the next levels. We will have experience, a bigger portfolio, and we will have had fun doing it.</p>
