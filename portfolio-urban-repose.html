  <p>The weary heart is not nursed to health in realms beyond our suffering;<br />
  the rejection of such realities stands to create false resolve.<br />
  While the threnody for solace is sung by the choir of the streets to the beat of our hearts,<br />
  it is the moments between the notes that gives us purpose.<br />
  Self amity in isolation does not equate with harmony in integration;<br />
  Nirvana can only be realized within the context of our lives.<br />
  <em>Peace, within chaos.</em></p>
