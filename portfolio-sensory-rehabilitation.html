  <p>In our world, we are continuously influenced by stimuli to all five senses. For our minds to process the massive quantity of information coming from the senses, we subconsciously filter out everything that we deem normal: sights, smells, sounds, textures. This coping mechanism allows us to function in everyday situations, but over time it robs us our ability to truly experience our environment.</p>
  <p>Rehabilitation is not a path reserved for the sick; it is a way to return to useful life or good condition through therapy and education.</p>
  <p>Sensory rehabilitation involves isolating senses one by one. When a sense is blocked we realize the stimulation that used to be present; we now only recognize the void that is left. Once we have eliminated all the stimuli that were part of our daily lives, we appreciate and recognize them. The reintroduction to stimuli that used to be ignored becomes an experience of transcendence â€“ rejuvenation.</p>
