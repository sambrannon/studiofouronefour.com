  <p>Located in historic Old Town, Chicago, the Wells Street Art Festival is one of the city’s largest and most acclaimed fine arts events. The annual festival features over 250 juried artists and attracts thousands of visitors to the area. Each year, the festival hosts a poster design competition to be used as the centerpiece of their promotional campaign.</p>
  <p>The curving, iron and gold material of Old Town’s landmark entrance gate preserves the neighborhoods lasting history. The poster illustrates the marriage of this rich charm with the exciting, changing and new ideas that are delivered by the Wells Street Art Festival each year.</p>
