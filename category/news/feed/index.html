			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Studio four one four has won it&#8217;s first competition!</h2>
<p>Hosted by <a title="Socio Design Foundation" href="http://www.sociodesignfoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Socio Design Foundation</a>, this competition&#8217;s challenge was to distill an idea down to a single vignette. The guidelines? Literally one line; &#8220;Space for the Rehabilitating&#8221;.</p>
<p><span id="more-393"></span></p>
<p>The monthly competition held by the SCF, to &#8220;recognized the spatial impact on the psyche of society,&#8221; is only our second entry into competitions since inception of the group, and has already yielded us a win.</p>
<p>We assembled a team to solve their design problem.  The solution presented was to question the connotations of the word &#8220;Rehabilitation&#8221;, and present in a light that everyone could be part of.  As in our depiction, we took the city and it&#8217;s sensory overloading nature and developed a journey for an individual to take a reprieve, or moment of repose among the chaos.</p>
<p>The figurative tunnel &#8220;journey&#8221; for each person would be to gradually take each stimuli away to make the participant aware of their senses that are being bombarded, and then reintroducing them in a healing way.  Rehabilitating the individual on the personal level.  When fully recharged, they can make the journey back to their daily lives but are aware of themselves and their surroundings; they are rehabilitated.</p>
<p>Team members included: Alex Harm, Joe Buccini, Nick Mather, Ryan Bratz</p>
